# gatsby-starter-gatsbythemes

This is a basic starter package for
[GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). I found myself doing the same
things over and over again when starting a new gatsby project, hence I figured
I should created myself a starter so that I don't have to start from scratch
every single time. Maybe this starter can be useful to some of you.

## What's included

Currently this starter includes the following:

1. CSS-in-JS via [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion).
2. Jest and Enzyme for testing.
3. Eslint in dev mode with the airbnb config and prettier formatting rules.
4. React 16.
5. A basic blog, with posts under src/pages/blog. There's also a script which
   creates a new Blog entry (post.sh).
6. A few basic components (Navigation, Footer, Layout).
7. Layout components make use of
   [Styled-Systems](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system).
8. Google Analytics (you just have to enter your tracking-id).
9. Gatsby-Plugin-Offline which includes Service Workers.
10. Prettier for a uniform codebase.
11. Normalize css (7.0).
12. Feather icons.

## How to use it?

If you have 'gatsby' installed globally, just start a new project with:

```
gatsby new my-project https://github.com/saschajullmann/gatsby-starter-gatsbythemes
```

If there is anything else you'd like to see included or changed, just let me
know.
